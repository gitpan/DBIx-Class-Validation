NAME
    DBIx::Class::Validation - Validate all data before submitting to your
    database.

SYNOPSIS
    In your base "DBIx::Class" package:

      __PACKAGE__->load_components(qw/... Validation/);

    And in your subclasses:

      __PACKAGE__->validation(
        module => 'FormValidator::Simple',
        profile => { ... },
        filters => 0,
        auto => 1,
      );

    And then somewhere else:

      eval{ $obj->validate() };
      if( my $results = $EVAL_ERROR ){
        ...
      }

METHODS
  validation
      __PACKAGE__->validation(
        module => 'FormValidator::Simple',
        profile => { ... },
        filters => 0,
        auto => 1,
      );

    Calls "validation_module", "validation_profile" and "validation_auto" if
    the corresponding argument is defined.

  validation_module
      __PACKAGE__->validation_module('Data::FormValidator');

    Sets the validation module to use. Any module that supports a check()
    method just like "Data::FormValidator"'s can be used here, such as
    "FormValidator::Simple".

    Defaults to FormValidator::Simple.

  validation_profile
      __PACKAGE__->validation_profile(
        { ... }
      );

    Sets the profile that will be passed to the validation module.

  validation_auto
      __PACKAGE__->validation_auto( 1 );

    Turns on and off auto-validation. This feature makes all UPDATEs and
    INSERTs call the "validate" method before doing anything.

    The default is for validation_auto is to be on.

  validation_filter
      __PACKAGE__->validation_filter( 1 );

    Turns on and off validation filters. When on, this feature will make all
    UPDATEs and INSERTs modify your data to that of the values returned by
    your validation modules "check" method. This is primarily meant for use
    with "Data::FormValidator" but may be used with any validation module
    that returns a results object that supports a "valid()" method just like
    "Data::FormValidator::Results".

    Filters modify your data, so use them carefully.

    The default is for validation_filter is to be off.

  validate
      $obj->validate();

    Validates all the data in the object against the pre-defined validation
    module and profile. If there is a problem then a hard error will be
    thrown. If you put the validation in an eval you can capture whatever
    the module's check() method returned.

EXTENDED METHODS
    The following "DBIx::Class::Row" methods are extended by this module:-

    insert
    update
